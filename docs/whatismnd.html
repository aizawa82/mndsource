            <h2>What is MND?</h2>
            <p>MND stands for motor neurone disease and is a group of diseases which cause a loss of function (degeneration) of nerve cells which control muscles (so called motor neurons). These cells are located in the brain and the spinal cord. ALS (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is particular form of motor neurone disease, often the abbreviations MND and ALS are used interchangeably. <br>
The symptoms of motor neurone disease can vary a great deal between different individuals and involve weakness of particular muscle groups, such as the muscles of the legs, arms, throat and chest.<br>
Although there is no cure available today there is intense research being conducted globally to find a cure.
Despite the absence of a cure much progress has been made in improving the quality of life of patients living with motor neurone disease through specialised teams. These teams include neurologists, rehabilitation specialists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists and a number of other specialised support services.<br>
For these reasons it is very important that care for MND patients is delivered by specialised teams. Our ambition is to extend this support to all Malaysians nationwide.<br>
Being given a diagnosis of MND, or going through a diagnostic workup to rule out MND are very distressing experiences. It is very important that patients have access to the information they need. While a lot of information is available online it is important for patients to speak to their doctors personally to gain the proper understanding of their individual situation.<br>
